/**
 * A <em>tool</em> defines an editing mode of a {@link DrawingEditor}.
 *
 * <p>Tools are used for user interaction. Unlike figures, a tool works with the user interface
 * coordinates of a {@link DrawingView}. The user interface coordinates are expressed in integer
 * pixels.
 *
 * <p>When a tool is set on a drawing editor using {@code setTool}, the drawing editor registers the
 * tool as a listener for mouse and keyboard events on all drawing views. The tool processes these
 * events and perform edit operations on the figures of the drawing, on the drawing itself or even
 * on the drawing view.
 *
 * <p>Tools inform listeners when they are done with an interaction by calling the ToolListener's
 * {@code toolDone()} method.
 *
 * <p>In a typical application, tools are created once and reused.
 *
 * <p>A tool forwards UndoableEdit events to the Drawing object onto which it is performing changes.
 *
 * <p>If a tool does not handle a specific keyboard event, it looks up the {@code InputMap} of the
 * drawing editor and then invokes the corresponding action in the {@code ActionMap} of the drawing
 * editor. A tool can have an InputMap and ActionMap of its own which take precedence over the ones
 * provided by the drawing editor.
 *
 * <p><hr> <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p><em>Framework</em><br>
 * The following interfaces define the contracts of a framework for structured drawing editors:<br>
 * Contract: {@link Drawing}, {@link Figure}, {@link DrawingView}, {@link DrawingEditor}, {@link
 * org.jhotdraw.draw.handle.Handle} and {@link Tool}.
 *
 * <p><em>Mediator</em><br>
 * {@code DrawingEditor} acts as a mediator for coordinating drawing tools and drawing views:<br>
 * Mediator: {@link DrawingEditor}; Colleagues: {@link DrawingView}, {@link Tool}.
 *
 * <p><em>Mediator</em><br>
 * {@code DrawingEditor} acts as a mediator for coordinating keyboard input from {@code Tool}s and
 * Swing action objects:<br>
 * Mediator: {@link DrawingEditor}; Colleagues: {@link Tool}, javax.swing.Action.
 *
 * <p><em>Observer</em><br>
 * State changes of tools can be observed by other objects. Specifically {@code DrawingEditor}
 * observes area invalidations of tools and repaints its active drawing view accordingly.<br>
 * Subject: {@link Tool}; Observer: {@link ToolListener}; Event: {@link
 * org.jhotdraw.draw.event.ToolEvent}; Concrete Observer: {@link DrawingEditor}. <hr>
