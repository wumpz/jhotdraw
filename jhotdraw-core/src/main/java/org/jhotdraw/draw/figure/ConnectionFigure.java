/**
 * A <em>connection figure</em> connects two figures with a {@link
 * org.jhotdraw.utils.geom.path.BezierPath}.
 *
 * <p>The location of the start and end points of the bezier path is defined by {@link Connector}
 * objects, which are supplied by the connected figures.
 *
 * <p>If a connected figure is removed, the connection figure needs to be removed as well. To
 * achieve this, {@code ConnectionFigure} listens to {@code figureRemoved} events sent by the two
 * figures that it connects, and then fires a {@code requestRemove} event to get removed as well.
 *
 * <p>The bezier path of the connection figure can be laid out using a {@link Liner}.
 *
 * <p><hr> <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p><em>Framework</em><br>
 * Two figures can be connected using a connection figure. The location of the start or end point of
 * the connection is handled by a connector object at each connected figure.<br>
 * Contract: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.figure.Figure}, {@link
 * org.jhotdraw.draw.figure.ConnectionFigure}, {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.connector.Connector}, {@link
 * org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.ConnectionTool}.
 *
 * <p><em>Strategy</em><br>
 * The control points of the bezier path of a connection figure can be laid out using different
 * layout algorithms which are implemented by a liner object.<br>
 * Context: {@link ConnectionFigure}; Strategy: {@link Liner}.
 *
 * <p><em>Strategy</em><br>
 * The location of the start and end points of a connection figure are determined by {@code
 * Connector}s which are owned by the connected figures.<br>
 * Context: {@link Figure}, {@link ConnectionFigure}; Strategy: {@link Connector}. <hr>
