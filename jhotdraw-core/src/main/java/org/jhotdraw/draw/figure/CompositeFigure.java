/**
 * A <em>composite figure</em> is composed of several child {@link Figure}s.
 *
 * <p>A composite figure can be laid out using a {@link Layouter}.
 *
 * <p>{@code CompositeFigure} listens to {@code requestRemove} events sent by its child figures, and
 * then removes the child figure which sent the event.
 *
 * <p><hr> <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p><em>Composite</em><br>
 * Composite figures can be composed of other figures.<br>
 * Component: {@link Figure}; Composite: {@link CompositeFigure}.
 *
 * <p><em>Observer</em><br>
 * State changes of figures can be observed by other objects. Specifically {@code CompositeFigure}
 * observes area invalidations and remove requests of its child figures. {@link DrawingView} also
 * observes area invalidations of its drawing object.<br>
 * Subject: {@link Figure}; Observer: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.event.FigureListener}; Event: {@link
 * org.jhotdraw.draw.event.FigureEvent}; Concrete Observer: {@link CompositeFigure}, {@link
 * DrawingView}.
 *
 * <p><em>Observer</em><br>
 * Changes in the composition of a composite figure can be observed.<br>
 * Subject: {@link CompositeFigure}; Observer: {@link
 * org.jhotdraw.draw.event.CompositeFigureListener}; Event: {@link
 * org.jhotdraw.draw.event.CompositeFigureEvent}.
 *
 * <p><em>Strategy</em><br>
 * Composite figures can be laid out using different layout algorithms which are implemented by
 * layouters.<br>
 * Context: {@link CompositeFigure}; Strategy: {@link Layouter}. <hr>
