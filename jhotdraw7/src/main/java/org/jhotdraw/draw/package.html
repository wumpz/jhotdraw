<p>
Defines a framework for structured drawing editors and provides default 
implementations. 
</p>
<h3>Package Contents</h3>
<p>
    All key contracts of the framework are defined by Java interfaces. For each
    interface exists an abstract class, which implements the event handling contract 
    of the interface. And finally, there is at least one default implementation
    of each interface.
</p>
<p>
The key interfaces for the representation of a drawing are: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{@link org.jhotdraw.draw.Drawing}</li> 
    <li>{@link org.jhotdraw.draw.Figure}</li>
</ul>
<p>
The key interface for displaying a drawing on screen is: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{@link org.jhotdraw.draw.DrawingView}</li>
</ul>
<p>
The key interfaces for editing a drawing are: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{@link org.jhotdraw.draw.DrawingEditor}</li>
    <li>{@link org.jhotdraw.draw.tool.Tool} (in sub-package "tool")</li>
    <li>{@link org.jhotdraw.draw.handle.Handle} (in sub-package "handle")</li>
</ul>
