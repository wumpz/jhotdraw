This is a patched version of NanoXML which is made to be compilable with Java
1.5 and to take advantage of the Java2 Collections API. 
<p>
NanoXML has been changed to not open a network connection to retrieve the DTD of
a document. This greatly reduces the time needed to read an XML document and it
allows to open XML documents when a computer is offline, or when a Java applet
runs in a restricted environment that doesn't allow connections to the computer
hosting the DTD.
